Implementation of the statsd in C++


# Introduction #

*Measure Anything, Measure Everything* is the philosophy behind the
inventors of the original statsd (https://github.com/etsy/statsd/).

Nevertheless: the existing implementations I found have all some
limitations.  Most of them are written in some interpreted or
*strange* language (from the point of a C / C++ programmer) which
cannot rolled out in the production systems I had to support. There is
one C implementation (https://github.com/jbuchbinder/statsd-c) which
has many bungs and design issues. The test coverage of mostly all
implementations is not that high.

# Status #
This project is currently in requirement management / collection
phase. 
(Sorry - no source code until now.)
